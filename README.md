# SOOOO LOOOONG
The goal was to create a 2D game in C, using either MinilbX library or MLX42. Also the norminette(linting) restrictions. 
I chose the second one, just because I liked the documentation, and the keys were predefined.

## My thoughts on the project
I had fun creating this project, and I would love to share my code with you guys.
I think the code is one huge bowl of spaghetti, so hopefully I will have some time in the future to refactor.
For now it works with at least one extra "feature" :D 
If you go diagonally, you get a bit of nitro gas in your a**, and speed up.
Also the counter is not perfect either.
If you find more "features" please let me know in comments :D
