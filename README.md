# SOOOO LOOOONG
The goal was to create a 2D game in C, using either MinilbX library or MLX42. 
I chose the second one, just because I liked the documentation, and the keys were predefined.
We were allowed to use only a few functions from C library, and the whole MLX42 lib.
So we are supposed to code most of the standard functions ourselves or use Libft from the previous 42 project.
In my opinion the norminette(linting) restrictions were the hardest part to fulfill.


## My thoughts on the project
I had fun creating this project, and I would love to share my code with you guys.
I think the code is one huge bowl of spaghetti, so hopefully I will have some time in the future to refactor.
For now it works with at least one extra "feature" :D 
If you go diagonally, you get a bit of nitro gas in your a**, and speed up.
Also the counter is not perfect either.
If you find more "features" please let me know in comments :D
